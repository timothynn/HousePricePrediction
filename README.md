# HousePricePrediction
I've used Machine Learning to create a model that predicts house prices in Melbourne :).

Libraries used include:

- Pandas
- Sklearn.

In further details, I have imported **ensemble.RandomForestRegressor**, **metrics.mean_absolute_error** and **model_selection.train_test_split** from **sklearn**
